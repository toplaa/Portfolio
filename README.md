# [Project 1- Machine-learning - Decision tree](https://github.com/toplaa/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Decision%20Tree.ipynb)
In this project, we will build a classification algorithm to build a model from historical data of patients and their responses to different medication. Then use the traine decision tree to predict the calss of an unknown patient to find proper drug
