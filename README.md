In this project, I built a classification algorithm to build a model from historical data of patients and their responses to different medication. Then used the trained decision tree to predict the calss of an unknown patient to find proper drug

# [Project 2- Publication from my PhD- Textural and Mineralogical Controls on Rock Strength Elucidated Using a Discrete Element Method Numerical Laboratory]

Numerical modelling techniques such as the discrete element method are now well established and extensively used in many applications including solid earth geoscience, materials science, geotechnical engineering and rock mechanics. The potential for this technique in understanding comminution mechanisms has been identified as highly promising. This work utilizes the discrete element method as a numerical laboratory to conduct investigations relevant to comminution that would otherwise be costly or time-consuming to perform in the field or laboratory. A benchmark numerical model for impact breakage of rock specimens is first established and validated against results of controlled laboratory experiments. Thereafter, the model is utilized to systematically investigate the potential dependency of ore breakage properties upon the prevalence of pre-existing fractures, as well as the mineralogical composition of the ore. These numerical experiments serve to highlight the potential for quantitatively relating the mechanical response of ore to its textural and mineralogical characteristics. Tandem utilization of numerical and laboratory experimentation to formulate and test hypotheses is a promising avenue to illuminate such relationships.
